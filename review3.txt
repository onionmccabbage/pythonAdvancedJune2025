========
if you wish, use microservices, DB, API, i/o context etc. within your work

Client Server (Microservices):
------------------------------
Write a new server (a microservice) as a front-end to your database from yesterday.
The client should send requests for specific creatures, posts or todos
The server responds by querying the database (or API) and returning 
a nicely formatted response about that creature, post or todo

Remember to use .encode() and .decode()

Then find a way for the client to ask the proxy server to 
add or update members of the database
(Work on one data-type first, such as creatures, then generalize for the others)
Optionally, the client can persist server responses as bytefiles 
(basically write to a byte file very time something happens, maybe use redirection)

Alternative (instead of the above)
-----------
In a server, check if the buffer is one of 'users', 'posts', 'todos', 'photos' or 'albums'
If so, fetch the relevant data set from jsonplaceholder and return it to the client
(either import your existing 'requests' code or write a module for this)
Find a way for the client to specify a category AND an id
(If a valid category is not passed, choose sensible defaults)
Adapt the client so it checks to see if a valid category and id have been injected as system argument variables
If not, ask for a category and an id number from the user, then pass these to the server
The server then requests 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/<category>/<id>'
and sends the response back to the client
e.g. requests.get( f'{apiURL}/{cat}/{id}' )
Make the server write a nicely formatted byte log file of every request it receives

Further Options
===============
Provide a means of context-switching the output from the server
For example the default could be printing to the console,
but context options could write to a text file or a byte file
Send context options in the client request to control how the server streams its output
